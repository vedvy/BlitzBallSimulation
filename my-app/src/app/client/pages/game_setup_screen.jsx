    /*Set Up Screen Works as such:
    
    1. Prompt the user to choose players (Should captains be chosen? Would this make an impact on anything UI-wise?) 
    for each team. Determine the best way to choose for red/blue team.
    2. Prompt the user whether this is a practice game or the real deal. Boolean would be integrated to 
    flag player stats or not. 
    2.5: Later on, you can add customization for team colors, etc.
    3. Ask which team will bat/pitch first
    4. Prompt the user to confirm these choices, showing the choices they made, and if they wish
    to make any additional changes (this can come later). Also make note that once the game starts,
    there is no way to end the game early, meaning the game must finish once started. Later on, 
    a button should be added to quit early, and also add a button to prompt whether a 4th inning
    should be played (it sometimes happens.)*/
