    /*Set Up Screen Works as such:
    
    1. Prompt the user to choose players (Should captains be chosen? Would this make an impact on anything UI-wise?) 
    for each team. Determine the best way to choose for red/blue team.
    2. Prompt the user whether this is a practice game or the real deal. Boolean would be integrated to 
    flag player stats or not. 
    2.5: Later on, you can add customization for team colors, etc.
    3. Ask which team will bat/pitch first
    4. Prompt the user to confirm these choices, showing the choices they made, and if they wish
    to make any additional changes (this can come later). Also make note that once a "real deal" 
    game starts, you'll need to figure out how to account for a early quitout regarding the stats(create a temp collection storing
    the real-time stats updates for players and either discard for early quit or apply to all players if game is completed fully?). 
    Later on, add a button to prompt whether a 4th inning should be played (it sometimes happens.)*/
